    What this is.
  </h2>
  <p>
    This is an army builder app for the miniature wargame Liber Militum Tercios.
    The game is played with 15mm or 28mm miniatures, is set in the 17th century and is focused on the Thirty Years War.
    This is an app I made with two things in mind: to learn Angular 2 and to promote this great game.
  </p>
  <h2>Copyright</h2>
  <p>
    Liber Militum Tercios is a game by 'El Kraken' and they have all the copyright to it. I do not intend to profit from this project in any way.
    Buy the game, it is really good and not very expensive.

  <p>
    The app itself is open source and made by me, Alexey Usachev. If you want to support the project, feel free to contribute. Translations to other languages are especially welcome.
  </p>
  <h2>What's done</h2>
  <p>At the moment the app has almost all the content from the base book, and some of the content from the Kingdoms expansion, namely Commander Traits and Modern Cavalry.</p>
  <p>You can print the roster in a convenient way or save as a PDF if you like.</p>
  <h2>What's coming</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>First of all, I will add all the armies and units from the second book.</li>
    <li>Next priority is a save feature, that will allow you to not only print your lists or save as pdf, but save your lists inside the application in a convenient manner.</li>
    <li>Check for special army requirements wil be implemented: at the moment you have to check for yourself.
    </li>
  </ul>
