A single Order Card can be used, if so desired, for all or some of the units of the Brigade. You must tell your rival if you use the Order Card in this way and what it will affect to avoid any confusion. When a Unit has to act you can designate the units affected by this joint order and activate them all sequentially, one by one. If any of the units of the Brigade should use an Order Card to perform a reaction, the Order Card that had been assigned to the Brigade will be revealed, and an identical Order Card will be placed, face down, in the units that are not reacting. Unfortunately, the dact of having to break the joint order allows the opponent to know the orders assigned to the remaining units. '
